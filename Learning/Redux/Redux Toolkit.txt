If we want to implement Redux in our project se we can use Redux toolkit(@reduxjs/toolkit package), rather than using legacy redux.

Redux Toolkit is an updated version of Redux.
Redux Toolkit(also known as RTK) is used for writing Redux Logic[Redux which take 100 line of code can be decreased to 40-50 line by using redux toolkit].
Redux Toolkit simplifies our code & eliminates many common Redux mistakes & bugs. 


When we work on big project we have to deal with state management, for state management we have -
1. Hooks( ContextApi, useReducer); 2. Redux; 3. Redux toolkit.


For eg(According to props drilling 1 image) -
If we want to pass data from grandparent to GChild-2 = we had to pass props/data from Grandparent => Parent => child => G-child2..

With the help of context Api/Redux =
We will make a store & directly passed the data whichever component needed.


useReducer Hook Syntax =>
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initial_value); 
in reducer we had state & action.
